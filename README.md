# Convergence Clubs in Labor Productivity and its Proximate Sources: Evidence from Developed and Developing Countries

## Unique points:
- Presents an updated empirical treatment on the issue of productivity convergence across countries.
- Provides a comparative view of developed and developing countries along multiple productivity-related variables.
- Includes data and Stata code to reproduce the main figures, tables, and analyses of the book.

## SEO metadata description:
Using a modern club convergence framework, this book investigates the cross-country dynamics of labor productivity and its proximate sources: capital accumulation and aggregate efficiency. 

## Brief summary:
Testing for economic convergence across countries has been a central issue in the literature of economic growth and development. This book introduces a modern club convergence framework to study the cross-country dynamics of labor productivity and its proximate sources: capital accumulation and aggregate efficiency. In particular, recent convergence dynamics of developed as well as developing countries are evaluated through the lens of a non-linear dynamic factor model and a clustering algorithm for panel data. This framework allows us to examine key economic phenomena such as technological heterogeneity and multiple equilibria. In this context, the book provides a succint review of the recent club convergence literature, a comparative view of developed and developing countries, and a tutorial on how to implement the club convergence framework in the statistical software Stata.
